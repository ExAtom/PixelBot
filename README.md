# PixelBot
Official Discord Bot for the **Lyedlik: The Pixel Game** project
> Try it out on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/avgsdu65v8)!

# Features
> There are lots of *useful* or *fun* features we try to put in our bot. Here are some examples:

### XP
> Everyone can gain **XP** by talking in a non-bot channel. Duplicated/one character/rapidly sent messages are *ignored*.
Commands:
* `.rank`: Shows your stats like what rank you are, leaderboard position, XP etc.
* `.leaderboard`: Shows the *TOP 5* member with the most XP.

### Fun
> Fun commands are the ones that doesn't really serve a purpuse, but we put it in because they are *cool*.
* `.minesweeper`: Generates a *"client side"* table of minesweeper using Discord's *spoilers* hiding emojis that are representing a *number* or a *bomb*.
